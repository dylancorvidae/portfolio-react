                <h4>Description:</h4>
                <p>A SPA multiplayer game built using Socket.io, React, and p5 that allows players to invite up to eight friends to a private lobby and race against each other to see who can solve a randomly generated maze the fastest. Built by a team of 4 in 6 days.</p>
                <h4>My Role:</h4>
                <p>As UI & UX design lead I shaped how our game looked and was experienced by the end-users. I built accessibility into this game for people who live with different types of color blindness and it meets the WCAG standards for contrast and color. I utilized Coblis, a color blindness simulator, to test my color palettes and screenshots of the game throughout the production. In addition to UI & UX I wrote all of the CSS, a large portion of the HTML, built some of the React components, and wrote some of the tests. I wrote and organized the supporting docs that our group worked off as we built our app.</p>

                <h4>My Role:</h4>
                <p>I was lead on UX for this project and responsible for writing all the played content of the game. Most dating simulator games are not queer friendly and I made our game open to all gender identities and orientations. I built some of the mongoose schemas & models, wrote some of the tests and routes, created the music, and participated in mob & pair coding game logic.</p>

                  <h4 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer:</h4>
                    <p>
                      This is just an estimate of possible dynamic loads in a rigging system that travels straight down from an anchor point. This does not take into account orbital motion which puts different strains on rigging equipment. For a more accurate estimate use a load cell sensor while running your act to determine your actual dynamic loads. Take the peak load from running your act using the load cell sensor and multiply by 6 to get your characteristic load.
                    </p>
                  <h4>Methodology:</h4>
                    <p>
                      (Weight of performers + weight of apparatus & rigging equipment) × dynamic adjustment factor × safety factor of 6 (from ANSI 1.43 2016 Entertainment Technology — Performer Flying Systems Subsection 4.6.5). 
                    </p>
                    <h5>Example:</h5>
                      <p>
                        (440lbs performers + 10lbs trapeze) × 3 (dynamic adjustment factor) × 6 (ANSI safety factor) = 8100lbs. max safety trapeze performers
                      </p>
                  <h4>Safety Notes:</h4>
                    <p>
                      Many times the weakest point in an aerial rigging system is the anchor point. Carefully examine your anchor point and trace the forces from the point of attachment to the main support structure down to the ground. Get assistance from a professional rigger or structural engineer if necessary. When in doubt of the structural integrity of the anchor point, Do Not Perform.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Acknowledgement for Dynamic Adjustment Factor:</h5>
                      <p>
                        Dynamic adjustment factor estimates provided by Bill Auld of Auld Entertainment, provider of professional rigging and rigging training. Bill started me out on my journey of rigging discovery and is a great human to learn the basics from. If you want to learn more about rigging I highly recommend one of his workshops.
